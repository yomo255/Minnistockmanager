## Ministockmanager

Mini Stock Manager is a program created to help and simplify the process of managing the inventory of a small store or mini-market, allowing for a detailed and up-to-date record of its products. It includes a .txt file so the user can view the products without running the program and store this file wherever they prefer. Developed exclusively using C++, with no use of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.

## Demo

Technically, our code is still an early version, which is why a demo will not be included for now.

## Features

Add product: A function that allows the user to add as many products as they want, along with the quantity and price of each.

View inventory: A function created so the user can view the current products without needing to add or edit anything.

Edit a product: A function designed so the user can modify the price of one or multiple products.

Exit: A function made so the user can leave the program whenever they wish.
