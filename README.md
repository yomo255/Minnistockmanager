## Ministockmanager

Mini Stock Manager is a program created to help and simplify the process of managing the inventory of a small store or mini-market, allowing for a detailed and up-to-date record of its products. It includes a .txt file so the user can view the products without running the program and store this file wherever they prefer. Developed exclusively using C++, with no use of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.
